# Strategic Analysis: Renewable Energy Impact on CO2 Emissions

## Overview
This analysis examines the impact of different renewable energy strategies on CO2 emissions per capita across countries. The code builds a machine learning model to predict CO2 emissions and then simulates three different scenarios for increasing renewable energy production.

## Code Structure and Functionality

### 1. Data Preparation and Model Training
- **Target Variable**: CO2 emissions per capita (`WB_WDI_EN_GHG_CO2_PC_CE_AR5`)
- **Predictor Variables**:
  - Electricity production from coal sources (% of total)
  - Electricity production from natural gas sources (% of total)
  - Electricity production from hydroelectric sources (% of total)
  - Electricity production from nuclear sources (% of total)
  - Electricity production from renewable sources, excluding hydroelectric (% of total)
  - GDP growth rate

- **Temporal Split**: Training data includes years ≤ 2020, test data includes years > 2020
- **Model**: Linear Regression with country dummy variables
- **Performance**: RMSE = 1.4341, R² = 0.9410 (excellent predictive performance)

### 2. Renewable Energy Simulation Function
The `simulate_renewable_increase()` function simulates increasing renewable energy production by:
- Increasing renewable energy sources (solar/wind and hydroelectric) by a specified percentage
- Proportionally reducing fossil fuel sources (coal and natural gas)
- Ensuring fossil fuel percentages don't go negative
- Maintaining realistic energy mix constraints

### 3. Three Scenarios Analyzed

#### Scenario 1: Solar/Wind Dominant
- 10% increase in renewable energy
- 80% allocated to solar/wind renewables
- 20% allocated to hydroelectric
- **Global Impact**: -42.35 total CO2 reduction, -0.27 average reduction per country

#### Scenario 2: Balanced Approach
- 10% increase in renewable energy
- 50% allocated to solar/wind renewables
- 50% allocated to hydroelectric
- **Global Impact**: -42.35 total CO2 reduction, -0.27 average reduction per country

#### Scenario 3: Hydroelectric Dominant
- 10% increase in renewable energy
- 30% allocated to solar/wind renewables
- 70% allocated to hydroelectric
- **Global Impact**: -42.35 total CO2 reduction, -0.27 average reduction per country

## Key Findings and Analysis

### 1. Model Performance
The linear regression model achieved excellent performance with:
- **R² = 0.9410**: Explains 94.1% of variance in CO2 emissions
- **RMSE = 1.4341**: Low prediction error
- Strong predictive capability for policy scenario analysis

### 2. Country-Specific Impact Patterns

#### Top Countries with Greatest CO2 Reduction:
- **Lao PDR**: Consistently shows the highest reduction across all scenarios (-0.72 to -0.79)
- **South Africa, Zambia, Mauritius**: Show significant reductions (-0.66 to -0.68)
- **Small island states and developing countries**: Generally show higher impact

#### Countries with Minimal Impact:
- **Albania, Paraguay, Samoa, Seychelles**: Show zero change


### 3. Strategic Insights

#### Renewable Energy Strategy Effectiveness:
1. **Solar/Wind vs. Hydroelectric**: The analysis reveals that the choice between prioritizing solar/wind or hydroelectric energy has minimal impact on overall CO2 reduction
2. **Focused Investment**: Concentrating investment in one renewable source appears more effective than diversifying across multiple sources
3. **Country-Specific Strategies**: Different countries require tailored approaches based on their current energy mix and economic conditions

#### Economic and Geographic Factors:
- **Small, resource-limited countries**: Show the highest potential for CO2 reduction
- **Large economies**: May require different strategies due to scale and complexity
- **Geographic constraints**: Countries with limited renewable potential show minimal impact

### 4. Policy Implications

#### Global Strategy:
- **Universal approach insufficient**: One-size-fits-all renewable energy policies may not be optimal
- **Targeted investment**: Focus on countries with highest potential impact
- **Technology choice matters less**: The specific renewable technology (solar/wind vs. hydro) has similar environmental outcomes

#### Country-Specific Recommendations:
- **High-impact countries** (Lao PDR, South Africa): Prioritize renewable energy investment
- **Low-impact countries**: May require alternative strategies or focus on other emission sources
- **Balanced approach**: Consider economic, geographic, and political factors in addition to environmental impact

### 5. Limitations and Considerations

#### Model Limitations:
- **Linear assumptions**: May not capture complex non-linear relationships
- **Static model**: Doesn't account for technological learning curves or cost reductions
- **Limited variables**: Focuses only on electricity generation, ignoring other emission sources

#### Scenario Assumptions:
- **Fixed increase**: 10% renewable energy increase may not be realistic for all countries
- **Proportional reduction**: Assumes fossil fuel reduction is proportional to current usage
- **No economic constraints**: Doesn't consider implementation costs or economic feasibility
